# Func

**Func is a toy [programing language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) of mine. It has a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) which compiles the source code to [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). I have plan to implement an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) too.**

# Func

**Func is a [functional programing language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (not pure though!). It's gonna be mainly [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) but will also have an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) for quick devolopement. The [Grammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) for func is defined [here](https://github.com/utshowmh/func/blob/main/GRAMMER.md).**
